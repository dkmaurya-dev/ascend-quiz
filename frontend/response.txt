This is a specific threshold that distinguishes it from simply being the most frequent element (the mode).\n\nA is incorrect because the majority element is about frequency, not value. The largest number might only appear once.\nB is incorrect because this defines the mode of the array, not the majority element. For example, in `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, both 1 and 2 are modes, but there is no majority element.\nD is incorrect because while the majority element will be the median if the array is sorted, being at the median index is not the defining condition; it's a consequence of the frequency condition.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is B. To verify that an array is sorted in ascending order, you must check the local ordering property for all adjacent pairs. This means iterating from the second element (index 1) to the end and confirming that `array[i] >= array[i-1]` for all `i`. If this condition ever fails, the array is not sorted.\n\nA is incorrect because it only checks the endpoints. The array `[1, 5, 2, 8]` satisfies this condition but is not sorted.\nC is incorrect because the average value has no bearing on the sorted order of the elements.\nD is incorrect because this condition is true for any array except one with all identical elements; it does not imply sorted order.",

The rightmost element is always considered a leader by definition, as there are no elements to its right.\n\nA describes the maximum element of the array, which is a different concept. An array can have multiple leaders but only one maximum value (unless there are duplicates of the max).\nC describes a fixed-point element, a completely different array property.\nD describes a local mode, which is related to frequency, not value comparison with subsequent elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",

This means the element at `arr[1]` moves to `arr[0]`, `arr[2]` moves to `arr[1]`, and so on. The element that was originally at the beginning (`arr[0]`) has nowhere to its left to go, so it 'wraps around' to the end of the array, becoming the new `arr[N-1]`.\n\nA describes an incorrect shift pattern.\nB accurately describes a right rotation by one position, not a left rotation.\nD describes reversing the array, which is a different operation from rotation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The main advantage of a hash set in this context is its performance. As you iterate through the original array, you can check for the existence of the current element in the hash set. This check operation averages O(1) time. If the element is not in the set, you add it to the set and to your result array. This makes the overall process very efficient, typically O(n).\n\nA describes a sorting-based approach, which is a valid but different method that usually has O(n log n) time complexity.\nC describes using a hash map (or dictionary) to count frequencies, which is also a valid method but is slightly more complex than simply checking for existence with a set.\nD is incorrect because standard hash sets do not preserve insertion order. A different data structure, like a linked hash set, would be needed for that specific feature.",
